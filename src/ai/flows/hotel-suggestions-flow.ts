Based on the user's current location (latitude: {{{latitude}}}, longitude: {{{longitude}}}) and any specific safety concerns they have ({{{safetyConcerns}}}), suggest a few reputable hotels in Tamil Nadu.

Consider these factors when selecting hotels:
*   Proximity to the user's location within Tamil Nadu.
*   Positive Google reviews, particularly regarding safety, security, and cleanliness in the TN context.
*   Hotel safety scores from reputable sources. You should only suggest hotels that score 7 or higher.
*   Price range appropriate for someone in an emergency situation.

Make sure the Google review summary focuses on the most recent reviews and extracts any mentions of the hotel's safety and security.
Remember to only suggest registered hotels, never suggest other types of establishments such as hostels or motels.`,
